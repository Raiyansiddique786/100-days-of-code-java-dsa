## 🔁 Weekly Goals

### Week 1–2 (Before Exams):
- Java basics: Loops, Functions, Arrays, Strings
- Light DSA (1 problem/day from GFG)

### Week 3–8 (Post Exams):
- Full DSA: Arrays → Recursion → LL → Trees → DP
- Solve 10–15 problems per week

---

## 🧠 Final Goals:
- [ ] Complete Java concepts (Sigma 7.0)
- [ ] Solve at least 250+ DSA problems
- [ ] Master recursion, trees, and dynamic programming
- [ ] Maintain daily consistency for 100 days
